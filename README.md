# DRISHTI: Revolutionizing Vision and Accessibility

## Overview

This project, **DRISHTI**, presents the development of a **CNN-based object detection system with stereo vision**, achieving a remarkable **78.5% accuracy**, particularly in **low-light conditions**. The system showcases innovative use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to tackle real-world challenges in object detection.

### Key Features:
- **Stereo Vision**: Improves depth perception and accuracy in object detection.
- **Low-light Performance**: Optimized to work effectively in challenging lighting environments.
  
In addition to object detection, the project includes initiatives aimed at **real-time text detection** and **multilingual text-to-speech conversion** for enhanced accessibility, particularly benefiting visually impaired users.

## Objectives:
- Achieve high accuracy in object detection using CNNs.
- Develop stereo vision-based depth perception.
- Implement real-time **text detection** for **multilingual** text-to-speech conversion.
- **Accessibility focus**: Improve usability for **visually impaired** users.

## Achievements:
- **78.5% accuracy** in object detection under low-light conditions.
- Contribution to **accessibility** through multilingual text-to-speech.
- Published a **research paper** outlining methodologies and outcomes.
